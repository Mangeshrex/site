üéâ Announcing the "Shell Script Showcase May" Challenge! üéâ

Welcome to the first ever monthly contest for Gnu Linux India group.

### What is it all about?

We are looking for the most innovative and unconventional shell scripts out there. Whether you're a seasoned shell
scripting guru or just dipping your toes into the terminal, this challenge is for you! Create scripts that dazzle,
scripts that surprise, and scripts that push the boundaries of what's possible in the command line.

### What can you do?

The possibilities are endless! You could whip up scripts that generate ASCII art from images, craft personalized
chatbots that chat up a storm, or even conjure up mini-games that provide hours of terminal-based fun. Let your
imagination run wild and show us what you've got!

### Rules

- Your script must be original and created by you.
- Your script must be shared with the community before 25th May.
- Your script must be written in any POSIX-compliant shell language. (..and bash, because why not?)
- Your script must be shared in a public repository on GitHub or Codeberg.

### How does it work?

1. Create your unique shell script during the month of May.
2. Share your masterpiece with the community before 25th May. (You can share on any of the communication channels, you
   can also give a github link.)
3. We will host a video call where everyone can show off their scripts.
3. The community will vote for their favorites via polls.
4. The script with the most votes wins!

### What's at stake?

As if the glory of winning weren't enough, the ultimate champion will receive a shiny **300 rupee Amazon gift card** as
a token of our appreciation for their shell scripting prowess.

So, dust off your keyboard, fire up your terminal, and get ready to amaze us with your shell scripting skills! Let's
make this "Shell Script Showcase May" one for the history books!

### Okay, but how do I join?

  This script is a digital companion for you. It can help you with absolutely nothing, other than just being cute. It's
  a simple script that displays a penguin which will grow as time goes by. You have to feed him by running the script
  every day. If you don't feed him, he will die. So, don't let him die. He also shows you the current date and time.
  That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. On the bright side, he is a good listener. You can talk to him whenever you
  feel lonely. He will listen to you without any judgement. So, go ahead and run the script. Have fun!
