You can use this button on your website, blog, or any other web property to show your support for GLI. The button is
88x31 pixels in size and looks great on any website.

## What is a web button?

A web button is a small image that you can place on your website to link to another website or web page. It is a simple
and effective way to show support for a cause, organization, or community.

## History of web buttons

Web buttons used to be a popular way to link to other websites in the early days of the internet. They were often small,
colorful, and eye-catching, making them stand out on a webpage. While they are not as common today, web buttons are
still used by many websites to promote products, services, or causes.

## How to use the GLI web button

To use the GLI web button on your website, simply copy the following code and paste it into your HTML:
