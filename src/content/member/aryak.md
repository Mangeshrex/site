I am just a random guy on the internet who happens to be a free software enthusiast. 

I am also a hobbyist sysadmin, and run [Project Segfault](https://projectsegfau.lt), a host of many privacy frontends.

I also develop [Mozhi](https://mozhi.aryak.me), which is a privacy frontend for multiple translation engines.
