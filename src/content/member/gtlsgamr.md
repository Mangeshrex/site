#### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hitarth, good to know you.

I'm passionate about dissecting TV shows, writing poetry that encapsulates moments from an average Indian life, and sharing tech insights that cater to both enthusiasts and newbies. In 2016, I ventured into the world of digital art, and the resulting collection is something I am proud of.

I'm also the founder of ~tildevarsh, a dynamic online community where discussions thrive, ideas are shared, and learning is a collective journey. Unfortunately, the community is currently closed down due to lack of time and resources. However, I'm hoping to bring it back to life soon.
