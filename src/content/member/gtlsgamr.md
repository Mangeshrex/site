#### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hitarth, good to know you.

I'm a software engineer by profession. I love to write code that solves real-world problems.

People always ask me what is the meaning of `gtlsgamr`. Honestly, I set it as a kid and it stuck with me. I don't really
know what it means. Recently this topic came up in the group and we asked chatGPT to generate a meaning for it. Here's
what it came up with:

> The handle "gtlsgamr" might stand for something specific in gaming or personal terms, such as "Get The Last Shot
> Gamer" or "Giant Turtle Lover, Seriously Gamer". This interpretation plays with the idea of acronyms to add mystery or
> humor to the persona.

So now, I guess I am Get The Last Shot Gamer. ðŸ˜„

I'm passionate about dissecting TV shows, writing poetry that encapsulates moments from an average Indian life, and
sharing tech insights that cater to both enthusiasts and newbies. In 2016, I ventured into the world of digital art, and
the resulting collection is something I am proud of.

I was also the founder of ~tildevarsh, a dynamic online community where discussions thrived, ideas were shared, and
learning
is a collective journey. Unfortunately, the community is currently closed down due to lack of time and resources.

However, I'm hoping to bring it back to life soon.
